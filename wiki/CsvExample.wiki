  * Rule definition
    * if *e* is a parsing expression, *Name <- e* is a rule named "Name"

    * *.* consumes any single character
    * *'lit'* or *"lit"* consumes a literal sequence of characters
    * *`[`a-z`]`* consumes a character if it is in the range
  * Lookahead parsing expressions
    * if *e* is a parsing expression, *!e* is a negative lookahead
    * if *e* is a parsing expression, *&e* is a positive lookahead
  * Repeating parsing expressions
    * if *e* is a parsing expression, *e?* is an optional expression (zero or one match)
    * if *e* is a parsing expression, *e`*`* is an optionally repeating expression (zero or more matches)
    * if *e* is a parsing expression, *e+* is a required repeating expression (one or more matches)
  * Set parsing expressions
    * if *e1*, *e2*, ... are parsing expressions, *e1 e2...* is a sequence parsing expression
